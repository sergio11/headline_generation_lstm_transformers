# 📰 Headline Generation Models: LSTM vs. Transformers

## 📝 Overview

This repository explores two cutting-edge approaches to headline generation using neural networks: **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Transformers**. Each approach leverages different strengths of deep learning to tackle the challenge of generating coherent and contextually relevant headlines.

### 🔄 LSTM Approach

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to handle sequential data. They excel at maintaining long-term dependencies and context across sequences, making them well-suited for tasks like text generation. In this project, the LSTM model processes a sequence of words and learns to predict the next word in the sequence, allowing it to generate headlines that are grammatically coherent and contextually meaningful. The LSTM’s ability to remember information over long sequences is particularly valuable for maintaining the flow and relevance of generated headlines.

### 🔀 Transformer Approach

The **Transformer** architecture, on the other hand, represents a more modern and powerful approach to sequence modeling. Unlike LSTMs, Transformers rely on a mechanism called self-attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence, regardless of their position. This architecture is particularly efficient at capturing complex dependencies in the data and can process entire sequences in parallel, leading to faster training times. In this project, the Transformer model generates headlines by attending to every word in a sequence simultaneously, enabling it to produce high-quality, context-aware headlines with a deep understanding of the relationships between words.

By comparing these two approaches, this project aims to highlight the advantages and trade-offs of each model in the context of headline generation. Whether you’re interested in the sequential memory capabilities of LSTMs or the parallel processing power of Transformers, this repository provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and evaluating both methods.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **📓 Notebooks**:
  - `LSTM_Headline_Generator.ipynb`: A notebook that guides you through the implementation and training of a headline generator using the LSTM architecture. It covers data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.
  - `Transformer_Headline_Generator.ipynb`: A notebook that details the implementation and training of a headline generator using Transformer architecture. It includes steps for data preparation, model design, training, and evaluation.

- **🛠 Wrapper Classes**:
  - `LSTMWrapper.py`: A Python class that encapsulates the trained LSTM model, offering an easy-to-use interface for generating headlines.
  - `TransformerWrapper.py`: A Python class that wraps the trained Transformer model, simplifying the generation of headlines with minimal setup.

- **📊 Results**:
  - A folder or section containing comparisons between the models, including sample headlines generated by each and their respective performance metrics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Required libraries (detailed in `requirements.txt`)

Install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🛠 Usage

1. **Training the Models**:
   - Open `LSTM_Headline_Generator.ipynb` to explore the LSTM model's data preprocessing, training, and evaluation process.
   - Open `Transformer_Headline_Generator.ipynb` to see the implementation and training of the Transformer model.

2. **Generating Headlines**:
   - After training, use the wrapper classes to generate headlines. These classes handle everything internally, making it easy to test the models.
   - Example usage:
     ```python
     from LSTMWrapper import LSTMHeadlineGenerator
     from TransformerWrapper import TransformerHeadlineGenerator

     # Initialize the headline generators
     lstm_model = LSTMHeadlineGenerator()
     transformer_model = TransformerHeadlineGenerator()

     # Generate headlines
     headline_lstm = lstm_model.generate('Input text for LSTM')
     headline_transformer = transformer_model.generate('Input text for Transformer')

     print("📰 LSTM Headline:", headline_lstm)
     print("📰 Transformer Headline:", headline_transformer)
     ```

### 📈 Evaluation
The notebooks include sections for evaluating the models, allowing you to compare their performance across various metrics. The results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each model in generating effective headlines.
